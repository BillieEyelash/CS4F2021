Rating: 3.25/5
This book was really interesting in terms of plot and worldbuilding, but the whole thing hinges on a very questionable relationship. It's hard to see the chemistry, though it's certainly funny to watch everything fall apart over and over again. I didn't care enough about most of the characters to mind. The magic is fascinating and creative, but could use some more development/details to make it even better.
I didn't like Ailesse much, as her only goals are a) kill this guy she's never met because that's definitely necessary and b) please her very evil mother. She blindly believes that murdering her soulmate and various animals is essential to secure her place as matrone, but it's really just cruel. In my opinion, her one redeeming quality was her relationship with Sabine. She's a supportive friend, and it feels like Sabine manages to bring out the best in her.
Bastien's plan for revenge is just wrong. Yes, his dad died. But he didn't need to take it out on the first girl who's vaguely connected to his murderer. That's not revenge--it's pointless murder. He's exhaustingly insistent on this plan, but he abruptly changes his mind when Ailesse shows up. Worse yet, this causes Jules to become very jealous and cause unnecessary conflict.
I really like Sabine's character because she is dedicated to helping her best friend. She is more sensible and kind than the rest of her famille, and I liked seeing how her beliefs clash with the expectations of her famille. Thankfully, she doesn't have an amoure or love interest, making her character even more appealing to me.
I did enjoy the magic and world of the Bone Criers. The ferrying and magic scenes were exciting and kept me reading. The action aspect to this book isn't as important as the romance, but it was one of the best parts. The romance is more amusing than romantic, but the action, accompanied by Sabine, are enough to make the book a fairly enjoyable read.
